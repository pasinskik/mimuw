# Computer Architecture & Operating Systems Projects

Three low-level programming projects written in **C** and **x86-64 Assembly**, focusing on boolean logic, multi-word arithmetic, and binary data integrity.

> **Note**  
> These projects depend on university-provided framework structure. Only core implementation files are included to highlight low-level programming style.

## Projects

- [NAND Logic Library (C)](NAND_library/README.md)  
  Dynamically linked C library modeling boolean circuits built from NAND gates.

- [Multi-Word Signed Division (Assembly)](Multiword_div/README.md)  
  x86-64 implementation of signed division on arbitrary-length integers.

- [CRC Checksum with Lookup Table (Assembly)](CRC_lookup/README.md)  
  Optimized CRC computation using a custom polynomial and byte-level LUT.
