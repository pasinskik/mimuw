# Computer Networks Projects

This directory contains C projects developed for university coursework focused on distributed systems and computer networking. Each project emphasizes **communication protocols**, **message handling**, and **robust synchronization logic**.

> **Note**  
> These implementations are educational in nature and prioritize protocol correctness and fault handling. They are self-contained and suitable for academic review.
