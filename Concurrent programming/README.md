# Concurrent Programming Projects

This folder contains two concurrent programming projects in Java and C.

> **Note**  
> These projects were developed against university-provided interfaces and test frameworks that are **not included** here.  
> Only the **core implementation code** is provided to showcase coding style and algorithmic design.

  Multithreaded evaluation of boolean expressions using Java threads and blocking queues.

- [Work-Stealing Recursive Solver (C)](Recursive_solver/README.md)  
  Lightweight task scheduler with work-stealing for recursive parallel computation.
