# Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This folder contains two C++ projects developed for university coursework. Each project highlights algorithmic thinking, dynamic programming, and advanced data structures.

> **Note**  
> These implementations are meant to demonstrate algorithmic clarity and code structure. They are self-contained but omit full testing infrastructure.

## Projects

- [Maximum Domino Tiling (Bitmask DP)](Domino_tiling/README.md)  
  Find the optimal tiling of a grid using dynamic programming and bitmasking.

- [Augmented Splay Tree (Sequence Management)](Augmented_splay_tree/README.md)  
  Maintain a dynamic sequence with fast updates and range queries using a self-adjusting tree.
